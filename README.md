# OpenML-credit-g
OpenML data id 31 classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. 
I analyze the data for feature correlation, important features.
Then I take the most imporant features and compare the accuracy of different estimators. The metric I use to compare the estimators is ROC AUC.
The four best estimators we found were SVM, Random Forrest, AdaBoost and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
